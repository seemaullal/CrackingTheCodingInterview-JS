##### Disclaimer ~9 years later
I started this repository in 2015. Since then JS has changed quite a lot. I haven't made any changes to incorporate things like Javascript classes, `let` and `const`, new methods and functions, or any of the many other new features introduced in the last 9+ years. I probably will not though who knows. If you found this somehow and found it helpful, I'm glad it provided some value and welcome any feedback or suggestions.

##### These are my solutions to problems from the book *Cracking the Coding Interview* (5th edition) in Javascript. I am also adding my implementations of common data structures. #####

The problems in the book are created for Java and C++ so not all are well suited for Javascript. Whenever possible, I have tried to do problems in the way the authors intended them to be done (for example, not using arrays to implement things like linked lists, stacks, and queues).

I welcome any and all feedbackâ€“ there are any issues, please feel free to add a Github issue. Additionally, I encourage contributions to this project. If you have your own solution in Javascript, please make a pull request.
