##### These are my solutions to problems from the book *Cracking the Coding Interview (5th edition)* in Javascript. I am also adding my implementations of common data structures. #####

The problems in the book are created for Java and C++ so not all are well suited for Javascript. Whenever possible, I have tried to do problems in the way the authors intended them to be done (for example, not using arrays to implement things like linked lists, stacks, and queues).

I welcome any and all feedback– there are any issues, please feel free to add a Github issue. Additionally, I encourage contributions to this project. If you have your own solution in Javascript, please make a pull request.
